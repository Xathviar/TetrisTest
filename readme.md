# Java Tetris Port


The goal of this project is to have modern tetris rules/physics but with retro styled tetris.

## Current ToDos: 

Removing Asciipanel and instead use lanterna, so that it can run from the terminal..
Using Nakama to optionally enable Multiplayer 1v1s and maybe other Game modes as well.
